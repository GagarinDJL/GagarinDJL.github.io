abstract: 'Online social networks have been integrated into people’s lives, and the Internet has become an ideal platform for disseminating information. Internet Word of Mouth Marketing (IWOM) is becoming increasingly attractive to companies. However, the dissemination of some promotional information can generate a large number of negative comments, damaging reputation and long-term profits. Therefore, it is of great significance to study information dissemination strategies so that beneficial information can be better promoted. The node selection strategy is investigated to maximize the amount of net positive information diffusion among individuals in signed online social networks. Given a signed online social network $G = (V, E, X, P, C)$, each edge $e \in E$ has an edge symbol $x \in X$ and a propagation probability $p \in P$. $C$ is the intensity of information interaction between individuals. The information propagation model is defined as the Signed Independent Cascade (SIC) model in signed networks. The problem of net positive information maximizing is to select a seed set containing $k$ nodes from the node-set $V$ and its assignment function $F: S \to \{+, -\}$ so that the amount of positive information minus the amount of negative information is maximum at the end of the spread. The problem is shown to be NP-hard and its objective function computation is #P-hard. Second, it is demonstrated that the problem is neither submodular nor supermodular due to the combined effect of information. Then, according to the propagation characteristics, the propagation path and its approximate calculation method are proposed. The problem is further constructed to solve a positive monotone submodular function. Third, an efficient maximum coverage greedy algorithm is designed to maximize the amount of net positive information. Finally, experiments conducted on real networks to verify that the proposed algorithm is superior to other methods and show that information diffusion is not equal to the dissemination effect.'
